Interactive view of division races in Major League Baseball

The data is gathered by the [getmlbstandings.py](blob/main/getmlbstandings/getmlbstandings.py) script, which uses the [MLB-StatsAPI](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) python package.

The website source is [app.ts](blob/main/showdivisionraces/src/app.ts), and the graphing code uses [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/). The code for the dark mode/light mode toggle is from [Ryan Feigenbaum](https://ryanfeigenbaum.com/dark-mode/).
